## Contributing Guidelines

### 1. Write tests then code

Writing the unit tests first will help you think through your problem and how to solve it better.

### 2. Think through the integration tests

Write new integration tests or extend the existing ones to accommodate your work.

### 3. Follow the code style

Have a good IDE that will enforce the code style. If you don't, frequently check the ES linter.

### 4. All tests green? Refactoring time

- Look for commented out code and get rid of it
- Add comments in complex areas (can you make it simpler?)
- Update documentation when needed, specially this very same document here.
